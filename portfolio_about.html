         Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, who found her unfriendly and somewhat of an <mark> "insufferable know-it-all"</mark>, an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way and quickly becoming friends. She later played a crucial role in protecting the <amrk>Philosopher's Stone</amrk> from Voldemort. In her second year, Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the <mark> Chamber of Secrets</mark>, before falling victim to the basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber, but she recovered from the petrification under the care of Madam Pomfrey with Professor Sprout's Mandrake Restorative Draught.
         <br><br>
         The next year, Hermione was granted permission to use a Time-Turner from the <mark>Ministry of Magic</mark> to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than was possible without time travel, though she and Harry later used it to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution. During her fourth year, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of house-elves, forming the association S.P.E.W., and helped in Harry's preparation for the <mark>Triwizard Tournament</mark>. In her fifth year, Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore's Army and fought alongside fellow D.A. members in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. In her sixth year, Hermione continued her role as Prefect and fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.
